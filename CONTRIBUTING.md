# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Kannada Flashcards project.

Key points
- The repository's main development branch is `main`. Please create feature branches off of `main` and open pull requests targeting `main`.
- The old `master` branch has been removed to avoid confusion — please make sure your local clones are updated (`git fetch --prune`) and that you work from `main`.

How to contribute
1. Fork the repository (if you don't have push rights) or create a branch locally:

```bash
# create a local branch off main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/your-descriptive-name
```

2. Make small, focused commits with clear messages.
3. Push your branch and open a pull request targeting `main`.
4. Fill the PR description with what the change does and how to test it locally.

Coding guidelines
- Keep changes small and self-contained.
- Preserve existing app behavior unless the change is intentionally altering it (document in PR).

If you're unsure about a larger change, open an issue first to discuss the approach.

Thanks — we appreciate your help!
